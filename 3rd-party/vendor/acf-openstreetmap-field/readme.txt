A configurable OpenStreetMap Field for ACF.

== Description ==

Hazzle free OpenStreetMap with [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

## Usage

#### In the Fieldgroup editor:

**Return Format:**

 - *Raw data* will return an array holding the field configuration.

 - *Leaflet JS* will return a fully functional leaflet map. Just include `<?php the_field('my_field_name'); ?>` in your Theme.
You can choose from a long list of map styles and it supports multiple markers.

 - *iFrame (OpenStreetMap.org)* Will return an iFrame HTML. Only four map styles are supported
– the ones you find on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) – and not more than one marker.

**Map Appearance:** Pan and zoom on the map and select from the Map layers to set the initial map position and style in the editor.

**Map Position:** If you're more like a numbers person here you can enter numeric values for the map position.

**Allow layer selection:** Allow the editors to select which map layers to show up in the frontend.

**Height:** Map height in the frontend and editor.

**Max. number of Markers**
 - *No value:* infinite markers
 - *0:* No markers
 - *Any other value:* Maximum number of markers. If the return format is *iFrame* there can ony be one marker.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

Please use the issues section in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/issues).

I will most likely not maintain the forum support forum on wordpress.org. Anyway, other users might have an answer for you, so it's worth a shot.

= I'd like to suggest a feature. Where should I post it? =

Please post an issue in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/issues)

= I am a map tile provider. Please don't include our service in your plugin. =

The provisers list is taken from [Leaflet providers](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers), so requests for an unlisting should go there first.

If you want your service to remain in Leaflet Providers, you can Post an issue in the plugin's [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/issues).
Please provide me some way for me to verify, that you are acting on behalf of the Tile service provider your want to exclude.
(E.g. the providers website has a link to your github account.)

= Im getting these "Insecure Content" Warnings =

Some providers – like OpenPtMap or MtbMap – do not support https. If these warning bother you, choose a different one.

= Why isn't the map loading? =

There is very likely an issue with the map tiles provider you've choosen. Some of them might be down or have suspended their service. Choose another one.

= I need to do some fancy JS magic with my map. =

Check out the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki). Some of the js events might come in handy for you.
For Documentation of the map object, please refer to [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com).

= Will you anwser support requests via emails? =

No.

== Upgrade Notice ==

**Attention:** Version 1.3.0 involves some breaking changes. 

**JS Events** are no longer triggered by jQuery‘s `.trigger(event)` but natively using the [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) type. 

As a consequence event Data is now stored in the [`details`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail) property. 

This was necessary in order to keep compatibility with the jQuery update in WP 5.6.

See the following wiki articles for more intel:

 - [JS-Event: Map Create](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/JS-Event:-Map-Create)
 - [JS-Event: Map Created](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/JS-Event:-Map-Created)
 - [JS Event: Map Create Markers](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/JS-Event:-Map-Create-Markers)
 - [JS Event: Marker Create](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/JS-Event:-Marker-Create)
 - [JS Event: Marker Created](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/JS-Event:-Marker-Created)
 - [JS Event: Map Init](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/JS-Event:-Map-Init)

The *`osm_map_iframe_template` filter* has been removed in favour of theme overrides.

Please refer to this wiki article for a [migration guide](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-openstreetmap-field/wiki/The-abandoned-osm_map_iframe_template-filter).
